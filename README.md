### Hello
My name is Gustav Jansson and I currently work for [StruSoft](https://strusoft.com/) in [Malm√∂ Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6), where I maintain and develop software written in:
* Java EE, C and JNI
* C#, C++.net and WPF
* C++, MFC and Qt

My current main focuses are divided between:
* my C++ "game engine" [euphoria](https://github.com/madeso/euphoria)
* my C++ scriping language [fel](https://github.com/madeso/fel)
* my C++ json library [json](https://github.com/madeso/json)

I'm currently trying to find the time to learn more about:
- Android development and Kotlin
- Creating and rendering 3d worlds
- Making my UI look less 'programmer made'
