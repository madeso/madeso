### Hello
My name is Gustav Jansson and I currently work for [strusoft](https://strusoft.com/) in [Malm√∂ Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6), where I maintain and develop software written in
* Java EE, C and JNI
* C#, C++.net and WPF
* C++, MFC and Qt.

My current main focuses are divided between
* my "game engine" project [euphoria](https://github.com/madeso/euphoria)
* my tiny scriping language [fel](https://github.com/madeso/fel)
* my c++ json library [json](https://github.com/madeso/json).

I'm currently trying to find the time to learn more about
- UX/UI
- android development
- 3d rendering.
