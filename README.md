### Hello
My name is Gustav Jansson and I currently work for [strusoft](https://strusoft.com/) in [Malm√∂ Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6), where I maintain and develop software written in Java EE, C#/WPF and C++/MFC/Qt.

My current main focus are my game engine [euphoria](https://github.com/madeso/euphoria), my tiny scriping language [fel](https://github.com/madeso/fel) and my c++ json library [json](https://github.com/madeso/json).

I'm currently trying to find the time to learn more about UX/UI, android development and 3d rendering.
